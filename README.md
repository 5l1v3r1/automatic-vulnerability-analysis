Automatic Vulnerability Analysis
==========
Recent advances in data analytics prompt dynamic data-driven vulnerability assessments whereby data contained from vulnerability-alert repositories and standardised enumerations. Yet, current vulnerability assessment processes are mostly conducted manually. However, the huge volume of scanned data requires substantial information processing and analytical reasoning, which could not be satisfied considering the imprecision of manual vulnerability analysis. In this project, we propose to employ a cross-linked and correlated database to collect, extract, filter and visualise vulnerability data across multiple existing repositories. In doing so, we aim to support a higher level of automation in vulnerability awareness and risk-analysis exercises.
